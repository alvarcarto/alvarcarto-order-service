Unfortunately the production and delivery of your order has taken longer than average because of a sudden increase in orders. We're so sorry about that.

Our production team is doing their best to get your package on its way as soon as possible. The tracking code will be sent to you immediately after that.


If you have any further questions, simply reply to this email or visit our help page ( {{ support_url }} ) for frequently asked questions.

Thank you,
